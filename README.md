# Figma2Frontend - Figma-to-Frontend Converter

## Introduction
The Figma-to-Frontend Converter is an open-source project that aims to streamline the process of converting Figma designs into frontend code. It provides a set of tools and utilities to bridge the gap between design and development, allowing developers to quickly and accurately implement designs created in Figma.

## Features
- **Design-to-Code Conversion**: Convert Figma designs into frontend code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) with high accuracy and fidelity.
- **Component Extraction**: Automatically extract design components and generate reusable code snippets for easy integration into your frontend framework.
- **Asset Export**: Export images, icons, and other assets from Figma to optimize them for web usage.
- **Style Guide Generation**: Generate a style guide based on the design system used in Figma, including typography, colors, spacing, and more.
- **Version Control**: Collaborate with other team members using version control systems (such as Git) to track changes made to the converted code.
